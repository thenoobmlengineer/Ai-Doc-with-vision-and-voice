With what I see, I think you have severe acne, possibly cystic acne, which can be painful and damaging to the skin. To manage it, I would recommend a combination of good skin hygiene, topical treatments like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, and possibly hormonal or anti-inflammatory medications if necessary.",,2025-03-19 20:38:36.772908
